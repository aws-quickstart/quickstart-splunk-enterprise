// There are generally two deployment options. If additional are required, add them here

This Quick Start provides two deployment options:

* *Deploy {partner-product-name} into a new VPC (end-to-end deployment)*. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, security groups, load balancers, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys {partner-product-name} into this new VPC.

* *Deploy {partner-product-name} into an existing VPC*. This option provisions {partner-product-name} in your existing AWS infrastructure.

The Quick Start provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and {partner-product-name} settings, as discussed later in this guide.

For further information about the dimensions of a Splunk Enterprise deployment, see the {partner-product-name} https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Capacity/DimensionsofaSplunkEnterprisedeployment[capacity planning manual^].  Finally, for additional information specific to an AWS deployment, see {partner-product-name} https://www.splunk.com/pdfs/technical-briefs/deploying-splunk-enterprise-on-amazon-web-services-technical-brief.pdf[AWS tech brief^] for instance sizing considerations.
